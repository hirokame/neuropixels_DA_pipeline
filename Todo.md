Todo
- Pipeline to concatenate the event file and DLC file with DA recording data.

- Spectral analysis
    - Power spectral density (PSD) Theta, beta, gamma, HFOs, etc.
    - Time–frequency spectrograms (wavelet or STFT)
    - Band-limited power (BLP) per trial/epoch

- Spike-LFP Coupling
    - Measures
    - Spike-triggered LFP averages (STA)
    - Phase-locking of spikes (circular statistics)
    - Spike–field coherence
    - PAC-related spike timing (spike-phase histograms)

- Current source density analysis (if useful for striatum analysis, idk what does it mean for striatum)
    - Might be useful to detect striosome-matrix boundary??

- Phase amplitude coupling
    - Beta and gamma

- HMM on LFP data
    - Have no idea how to do

- Align to events
    - Movement onset
    - Wheel phase transition (your step-wheel is perfect for this)
    - Reward delivery
    - Optogenetic stimulation onset/offset
    - DA transient peak timing

- LFP motifs: Treat LFP like symbolic sequences like
    - State-specific oscillation motifs
    - Sequence replay (in cortex & hippocampus)
    - Low-dimensional embeddings
    - Useful for chunking, habit, DLS attractor dynamics.
